# rss
A [maubot](https://github.com/maubot/maubot) that posts RSS feed updates to Matrix.

## Usage
Basic commands:

* `!rss subscribe <url>` - Subscribe the current room to a feed.
* `!rss unsubscribe <feed ID>` - Unsubscribe the current room from a feed.
* `!rss subscriptions` - List subscriptions (and feed IDs) in the current room.
* `!rss notice <feed ID> [true/false]` - Set whether the bot should send new
  posts as `m.notice` (if false, they're sent as `m.text`).
* `!rss template <feed ID> [new template]` - Change the post template for a
  feed in the current room. If the new template is omitted, the bot replies
  with the current template.
* `!rss postall <feed ID>` - Post all entries in the specified feed to the
  current room

### Templates
The default template is `New post in $feed_title: [$title]($link)`.

Templates are interpreted as markdown with some simple variable substitution.
The following variables are available:

* `$feed_url` - The URL that was used to subscribe to the feed.
* `$feed_link` - The home page of the feed.
* `$feed_title` - The title of the feed.
* `$feed_subtitle` - The subtitle of the feed.
* `$id` - The unique ID of the entry.
* `$date` - The date of the entry.
* `$title` - The title of the entry.
* `$summary` - The summary/description of the entry.
* `$link` - The link of the entry.

Furthermore, regular expressions can be used inside the template using double curly braces.
The regular expression will be matched against the entry content and replaced with the match.
E.g., the template string `{{ https://[^ ].jpg }}` will be replaced by the first link to an image file in the entry.
